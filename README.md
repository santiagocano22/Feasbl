# Find the Path Puzzle

Welcome to the **Find the Path Puzzle** project. The goal of the project is to implement a solver for the puzzle mini-game explained in the challenge description.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or newer

## Running the Project

In order to help you test your work, we have provided a source code of simple command-line application under the `src/app` folder. To run the application, you can run script `main.py` from your IDE or from the command-line as shown below:
```
python3 main.py  # or python main.py or py -3 main.py depending on your system
```

You should read it to figure out how to properly implement `PathFinder` class and throw exceptions. You are also encouraged to modify the testing code and write your own tests.
